	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		City Walks was created to help people discover the soul of a city through the simple act of walking. 
		We believe that the best way to truly experience a place is on foot, where you can notice the details, 
		interact with locals, and stumble upon hidden gems that you'd never find from a car or bus.
	</p>

	<h2>Why Walking?</h2>
	<p>
		Walking is the most human way to explore. It connects us to our environment at the perfect pace - 
		fast enough to cover ground, slow enough to really see. Every city has layers of history, culture, 
		and character that reveal themselves only to those willing to wander on foot.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Curation Process</h2>
	<p>
		Each walking route is carefully researched and tested by local explorers and travel experts. 
		We consider factors like:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Historical significance and cultural value</li>
		<li>Safety and accessibility for walkers</li>
		<li>Mix of famous landmarks and local discoveries</li>
		<li>Logical flow and compelling narrative</li>
		<li>Availability of rest stops and facilities</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>For Every Walker</h2>
	<p>
		Whether you're a first-time visitor looking for highlights or a local seeking new perspectives, 
		our walks are designed for all levels. We provide clear difficulty ratings, estimated times, 
		and detailed information to help you choose the perfect route for your interests and abilities.
	</p>

	<h2>Community Driven</h2>
	<p>
		Our best routes come from passionate locals who know their cities inside and out. We work with 
		historians, local guides, and urban explorers to ensure each walk tells authentic stories and 
		showcases the real character of each destination.
	</p>

	<h2>Beyond Tourism</h2>
	<p>
		We're not just about sightseeing - we're about connection. Our walks encourage sustainable, 
		respectful exploration that benefits local communities. We highlight local businesses, 
		cultural sites, and community spaces along every route.
